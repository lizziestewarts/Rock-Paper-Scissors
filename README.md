# Rock Paper Scissors Game (in python)
## Plan
Define the Scope: Decide on the basic features:
- Two-player mode (against the computer).
- Input validation (ensure the user only chooses rock, paper, or scissors).
- Score tracking (best of 3 or 5 rounds).
- Optional: Add difficulty levels or an option to play with another person.

Outline the Structure: Plan the project structure:
- A single Python file (main.py).
- A folder for tests (tests/).
- A README file (README.md) for documentation.
