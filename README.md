# Rock Paper Scissors Game (in python)
## Plan
Decide on the basic features:
- Two-player mode (against the computer).
- Input validation (ensure the user only chooses rock, paper, or scissors).
- Use Tkinter for GUI

Plan the project structure:
- A single Python file (main.py).
- A folder for tests (tests/).
- A README file (README.md) for documentation.

## How to run game
Run `python main.py` in your terminal or if Python3 `python3 main.py`
